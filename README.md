# node-require-no-cached #
This module is essentially node's `require`,
but every time a module is loaded with node-require-no-cached
tha module is loaded as if it is its first time being `require`d.

I wrote this for testing modules in the node REPL.
I wanted to be able to change the code and then
require my module again and get the current version of the code
without restarting the REPL.

## Installation ##
```shell
npm install require-no-cached
```

## Usage ##
```javascript
var rerequire = require('require-no-cached');

// Use it just like require
var mod = rerequire('module-slug');

/* Do stuff with normally mod */
```
